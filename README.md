# Word-Finder-in-C-
This project uses basic C++ functionality to allow the user to play a game wherein he/she uses the mouse to find meaningful words from a grid of letters.

The program was created using a turbo C environment. 
It uses IO, graphics and file operations.

The scope is purely entertainment based.

Run the DISP.exe file to start the program.

Classic mode - Make words till time runs out
Survival mode - Make words till you get a wrong word or time runs out.
